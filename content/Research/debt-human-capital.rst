This paper shows that lenders can have a strong influence on firmsâ€™ governance outside payment and technical default states by exerting ex-ante control over managerial turnover, not through dismissal, but via retention and selection. Examining private loan agreements, we find 8.5% of firms have change of management restriction (CMR) clauses. We show CMRs are binding: CEO turnover decreases during the loan contract term. The risk arising from the inability to transfer human capital from the individual to the firm informs this contracting practice: CMR clauses tend to be adopted when managers are likely to possess unique skills and in states where the enforcement of non-compete clauses is weaker. We also find evidence consistent with lenders using CMR clauses to limit risk taking behavior.  Finally, CMR inclusion is associated with lower yields, indicating they are in place to protect lenders, rather than to entrench existing management.
