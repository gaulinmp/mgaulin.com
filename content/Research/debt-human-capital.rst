This paper shows that human capital risk associated with management impacts debt contract design, but in ways not anticipated in the literature.
We find that lenders can include change of management restrictions (CMRs) giving them explicit control over managerial retention and/or selection decisions.
Lenders include CMRs to diminish human capital risk.
Shareholdersâ€™ role in mitigating or exacerbating human capital risk faced by lenders is an important determinant of CMR inclusion.
Additionally, the likelihood of CEO turnover more than halved during CMR terms, suggesting that these clauses are respected and that lenders can influence managerial turnover outside of default states.
