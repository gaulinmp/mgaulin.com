This paper shows that CEO compensation policies respond to debt contracting. We develop a novel
measure of creditor-shareholder disagreement based on the performance metrics used in loan versus
compensation contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design around loan covenant violations, we find
that violations cause firms to switch toward the class of metrics used by creditors. Additionally, violating
firms provide less risk-taking incentives and impose more difficult performance targets. Overall, our
results are consistent with compensation contracts serving as commitment devices to decrease the agency
cost of debt. They also reveal a channel through which creditors influence corporate governance.
