This paper shows that firms adjust CEO compensation policies when creditors’ interestsare more salient.
This effect helps explain controversial compensation practices such asweak performance incentives and short pay duration.
Our findings also show that tomitigate the agency cost of debt, compensation contracts can reflect not only the firm’scapital structure but the debt contract itself.
For example, firms tend to contract onaccounting-based goals when creditors do as well.
Our analysis relies on a regressiondiscontinuity design around loan covenant violations.
We also confirm our conclusionsstudying a broad sample of financially constrained firms seeking debt financing.
