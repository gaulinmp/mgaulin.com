This project's aim was to generate an unbiased estimate of the incidence
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in four urban counties in Utah. A multi-stage
sampling design was employed to randomly select communityrepresentative participants 12 years and over. Between May 4 and June
30, 2020, surveys were completed and sera drawn from 8,108
individuals belonging to 5,125 households. A qualitative
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to detect the
presence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2. The overall prevalence of IgG
antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 0.8%. The estimated
seroprevalence-to-case count ratio was 2.4, corresponding to a detection
fraction of 42%. Only 0.2% of individuals who had a nasopharyngeal
swab collected were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) positive. The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Utah urban
areas between May and June was low and the prevalence of positive RTPCR even lower. The detection fraction for COVID-19 in Utah was
comparatively high.
