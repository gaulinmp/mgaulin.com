The Accounting literature has recently grown its adoption of textual data as a source of accounting information.
Recent studies have employed various methods to do large scale natural language processing to compare textual documents across firms and across time.
This paper studies the extant technical methods adopted in the literature, and compares them to new advances in computational linguistics to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the various employed techniques.
We demonstrate that the commonly used approaches limit disclosure comparison to literal matches, effectively requiring exact word usage similarity when comparing documents.
Our approach allows us to capture the context, or or underlying meaning, of disclosures while being agnostic about which specific words are chosen.
We demonstrate the flexibility of our method in identifying ex-ante predicted network effects in disclosures, such as industry clustering and compensation consultant similarity.
