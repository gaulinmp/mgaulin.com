*Data Analysis*

    I have broad data-analysis experience with Python, MATLAB, SAS, STATA and SQL. Prior to my doctoral studies, I did extensive vision-based analysis and control in LabVIEW.

*Software Development*

    My work experience includes software development projects that range from small scripts to GUI programs to distributed software architecture.
    Currently, I focus on data analysis, both algorithm development and data cleaning.
    I develop mostly on \*NIX machines, but have used Windows in the past.
