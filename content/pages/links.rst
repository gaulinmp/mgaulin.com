Code and Links
#############################################
This page lists code I've shared as well as any websites or tutorials I've come across that I've found helpful in the past.

Code Uploads:
--------------------------------------

Macros.SAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've compiled some code into a Macros.SAS file that I use frequently. The code is hopefully self documenting, to include it use the command %include("path to file/MACROS.SAS");.

Notepad++ Syntax Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've put together the some syntax highlighting for SAS and STATA for Notepad++. See these directions for instructions on how to apply the syntax highlighting (save the userDefineLang.xml file to C:/Program Files/Notepad++ or its equivalent). I got the original documents from here and here, thanks to those authors. »

Links
--------------------------------------

My SAS Coding Blog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I randomly post tips/tricks/code snippits to a blog. I update it rately, typically only when I'm actively working on SAS full time, but perhaps there's some signal in all that noise. »

The following are links to other sites/resources, all credit to the original authors.

Compustat Legacy Code Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This site lists the lookup from legacy compustat codes to newer version compustat alphabetical references (e.g. Compustat #1 -> "AT"). »

Great website written by Ed deHaan with lots of helpful SAS and STATA links. »
